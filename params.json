{"name":"Icstextbookapplication","tagline":"An exchange textbook database model using ORM and the Play Framework","body":"# Welcome to the ICS Textbook Application Project\r\n\r\nThe project is intended to create a web application available for the Computer Science students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa to sell and buy used computer science textbooks. These textbooks are books only used in the classes offered at the Information and Computer Science department at Manoa. \r\n\r\n## **NOTE**\r\nThis project is under work so it is not available yet for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n* Students can either: \"Make an offer\" to sell books, or \"Make a request\" to buy books.\r\n* Books are pre-defined, making it more neatly the web application. For example, it makes easier to search for books.\r\n\r\n## Functional Elements\r\nAs of 5/8/2013, \"Making an offer\" and \"Making a request\", both work properly. Both were tested also using FluentLinium. Also, editing and deleting either an offer or request works.\r\n\r\n## To be implemented\r\n* Ideally, we want a registration form for students to use the web application. We need also to identify that the students are from the Computer Science department at UHM.\r\n* Search for offers and requests is not yet implemented. It should be a top priority since it is an essential feature for the web application.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots of the website\r\n\r\nLogin screen\r\n![Login Screen] (http://alexcamliu.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot-from-2013-04-26-222140.png)\r\n\r\nUser's offers and requests\r\n![Owner books] (http://alexcamliu.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot-from-2013-04-26-222127.png)\r\n\r\nSearch for offers and requests\r\n![Search offers](http://alexcamliu.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot-from-2013-04-26-222205.png)\r\n![Search requests](http://alexcamliu.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot-from-2013-04-26-222103.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
